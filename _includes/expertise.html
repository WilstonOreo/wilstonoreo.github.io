            My name is <b>Michael Winkelmann</b> and software is my passion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2023, I work as an <b>independent software consultant</b> to help customer to succeed with their software solutions. With a background in computer graphics and image process and my diverse skill set encompassing project management to software architecture and a proven track record in developing user interfaces, I bring a holistic approach to software development.
        </p>
        <p>
            My main expertise is <b>developing user interfaces</b> for embedded and desktop software with the <a href="https://contribute.qt-project.org/">Qt framework</a>. In 2012, I built my first user interface with Qt while studying Computer Graphics at TU Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>
            For 7 years, I was working for <a href="https:///www.qt.io"></a>The Qt Company</a> as Principal Software Engineer and Advisor.
            During my time at Qt, I helped <b>dozens of customers from different industries</b> and was able to gain deep insights into the framework.
        <p>
            Like Qt, I work <b>cross-platform</b>: I have developed software for Linux, Windows, MacOS and micro-controllers and I am not shy to code on other platforms.
            Besides my Qt background, I also have used <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> and the <a href="https://slint.dev/">Slint</a> framework for implementing user interfaces.
