description: In addition to our training and workshop offerings, I provide <b>in-depth code audit services</b> to ensure the highest standards of quality and security in your software projects. I will meticulously <b>review your codebase</b>, identifying potential vulnerabilities, <b>optimizing performance bottlenecks</b>, and ensuring adherence to industry best practices. We can discuss the findings of the audit in a workshop, and I deliver the audit results as pull request or as detailed audit report - whatever is required.
